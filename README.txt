ALPHA RELEASE:

Contributions:

Sonam Benakatti (40%)
- Login screen and functionality
- Facebook login
- Navigation between UI's
- Settings functionality

Jennifer Rethi (30%)
- Setup server using multipeer connectivity framework to enable connection between players

Gerlou Shyy (30%)
- Created ViewControllers for each screen
- Added buttons, labels
- Added constraints

Deviations:

- In our original document we discussed a child mode vs. adult mode - this is essentially the same but we renamed them to be one player mode vs. two player mode

- We did most of the basic UI navigation, but did not completely finish the views for the storylines because we chose to ensure the login implementation was working fully instead


Special Instructions:

- You have to open the file LibsWithPals/Libs With Pals.xcworkspace (as opposed to the Libs with Pals.xcodeprog)

- Use an iPhone 8 Simulator

- To login with Facebook, use this test account:

email: libs_mkpqmlt_pals@tfbnw.net
password: libswithpals

- To test the connection between two players, you need to set two player mode on and you need to run it on an iPhone and a simulator at the same time
